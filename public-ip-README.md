# PowerShell Scripts for Automation and API Testing

This repository includes practical PowerShell scripts developed to improve scripting proficiency, streamline tasks, and interact with external systems through REST APIs.

## Included Scripts

### `chuck-api.ps1`
Calls an external API to return a random Chuck Norris joke. Includes both single-call and looped versions.

### `public-ip.ps1`
Fetches the machineâ€™s current public IP address using a REST API.

## Tools Used
- PowerShell 7
- Visual Studio Code
- Git for version control

## Purpose
These scripts were created as part of a self-directed initiative to sharpen automation skills and build tools that reflect real-world use cases. Each script demonstrates command-line control, API handling, and task automation with clean, reusable code.
